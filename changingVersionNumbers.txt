When releasing a new version version numbers need to be updated on several locations:
MapWinGIS.rc lines: 56, 57, 75, 71
MapWinGIS.cpp lines: 21, 22
MapWinGIS.odl line: 1835 (helpfile("MapWinGIS.chm"))
                  , 1848 (helpstring("Dispatch interface for Map Control"))

If you want to update AxInterop.MapWinGIS.dll and Interop.MapWinGIS.dll
just delete them, unregister the ocx using
regsvr32 /u /s MapWinGIS.ocx
Rebuild the MapWinGIS solution.
register the ocx again using regMapWinGIS.cmd
Start a new project in VS2008.
Add a reference to the MapWinGIS Components (using the COM tab of the reference form)
Compile and in the bin folder of this temp project a new Interop.MapWinGIS.dll is created.
Add a form to your project and drag the MapWinGIS component on your form.
Recompile and a new AxInterop.MapWinGIS.dll is also created.

Copy these two interop dll to the bin folder and you're ready to go.
