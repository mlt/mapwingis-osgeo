Place somewhere in code:


// cdm 1/27/2006
#ifdef _DEBUG
#include "../debugging/MemLeakDetect.h"
#pragma warning(disable:4100)
CMemLeakDetect gMemLeakDetect;
#endif


Remove when done! Don't compile an OCX for real-world use with the above code in place.

Note: When the code first loads, it'll die with an unhandled exception -- just resume and continue normally and all will be well for memory testing purposes.
