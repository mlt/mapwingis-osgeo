## Proj4 ##
Do the steps mentioned in BuildProj4.txt


## GEOS ##
Do the steps mentioned in BuildGeos.txt


## ERDAS ECW JPEG2000 ##
Download the SDK from 
http://geospatial.intergraph.com/products/other/ecw/ERDASECWJPEG2000SDK/Downloads.aspx
Install it on another computer and copy the following folders to your dev environment:
* include
* lib
* redistributable


## LizardTech MrSid ##
Download the 32Bit and 64Bit SDKs from
https://www.lizardtech.com/developer/
You'll need to register first.


## NetCDF ##
Download the netCDF libs and binaries from Tamas his site:
http://vbkto.dyndns.org:1280/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1500-gdal-mapserver.zip
* release-1500-gdal-mapserver.zip
* release-1500-gdal-mapserver-libs.zip
and place them in the general bin, lib and include folders:
C:\dev\SupportingLibraries\GDAL\bin /lib and /include
### TODO ###
We need to update to the latest stable version available


## GDAL ##
Copy nmake.local to your GDAL-folder and check the paths in this file.
Also compare the settings with [GDAL-folder]/nmake.opt

In [GDAL-folder]/nmake.opt
Change DLLBUILD=1 to DLLBUILD=0
In [GDAL-folder]/makefile.vc
at the end in the devinstall macro add
	copy frmts\gtiff\libgeotiff\*.h $(INCDIR)
	copy frmts\gtiff\libgeotiff\*.inc $(INCDIR)
	copy frmts\gtiff\libtiff\*.h $(INCDIR)
and change copy gdal_i.lib $(LIBDIR) to copy gdal.lib $(LIBDIR)

[geos-folder]capi\geos_c.h (this file is restored during build of GEOS): 
Change #include <geos/version.h> to #include <geos_version.h>
Change #include <geos/export.h> to #include <geos_export.h>

[gdal-folder]gcore\gdaldllmain.cpp:
Remove (or comment) the dllmain implementation, because this doesn't work
with static libraries.


## SpatialIndex ##
## For now keep using the 'old' version because the new version of this
## Library isn't compiling
Replace the used extentions "idx" with "mwx" and "dat" with "mwd" 
in storagemanager\DiskStorageManager.cc (lines 36 and 140) and capi\Utility.cc (line 140)
Run makeSpatialIndex-32Bit.bat in a Visual Studio Command Prompt.


## Copy needed files to MapWinGIS folder ##
Run Copy2MapWinGIS.bat
