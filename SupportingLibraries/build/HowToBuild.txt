* How to build MapWinGIS.ocx

***************************************************
Since MapWinGIS v4.9.1 we use the pre-build binaries
of Tamas (http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk).
This has dramatically simplyfied the build process.
First download the bins and libs from GisInternals.
Since MapWinGIS v4.9.3 we use the GDALv2 library.
At this moment it is not yet formally released so we now use the -development files.
Browse to http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-mapserver.zip (this is a link not a file!)
and download 
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-mapserver.zip
http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/Download.aspx?file=release-1600-gdal-mapserver-libs.zip
Because Tamas does not yet provide VS2013 binaries we use his VS2010 (1600) binaries.
Unzip these files in \MapWinGIS\trunk\SupportingLibraries\GDAL_SDK\{platform}\

Now you can compile the ocx, using VS2010.
Don't forget to register it using \MapWinGIS\trunk\bin\Win32\regMapWinGIS.cmd and you are
ready to go.
Don't forget you also need the 32-Bit version if you want to use the ocx in Visual Studio in your forms.
Visual Studio (even VS2013) doesn't support 64-Bit ActiveX controls.

## Proj4 ##
Do the steps mentioned in BuildProj4.txt


## GEOS ##
Do the steps mentioned in BuildGeos.txt


## ERDAS ECW JPEG2000 ##
Download the SDK from 
http://geospatial.intergraph.com/products/other/ecw/ERDASECWJPEG2000SDK/Downloads.aspx
Install it on another computer and copy the following folders to your dev environment:
* include
* lib
* redistributable


## LizardTech MrSid ##
Download the 32Bit and 64Bit SDKs from
https://www.lizardtech.com/developer/
You'll need to register first.


## NetCDF ##
Download the netCDF libs and binaries from Tamas his site:
http://vbkto.dyndns.org:1280/sdk/PackageList.aspx?file=release-1500-gdal-mapserver.zip
* release-1500-gdal-mapserver.zip
* release-1500-gdal-mapserver-libs.zip
and place them in the general bin, lib and include folders:
C:\dev\SupportingLibraries\GDAL\bin /lib and /include
### TODO ###
We need to update to the latest stable version available


## GDAL ##
Copy nmake.local to your GDAL-folder and check the paths in this file.
Also compare the settings with [GDAL-folder]/nmake.opt

In [GDAL-folder]/nmake.opt
Change DLLBUILD=1 to DLLBUILD=0
In [GDAL-folder]/makefile.vc
at the end in the devinstall macro add
	copy frmts\gtiff\libgeotiff\*.h $(INCDIR)
	copy frmts\gtiff\libgeotiff\*.inc $(INCDIR)
	copy frmts\gtiff\libtiff\*.h $(INCDIR)
and change copy gdal_i.lib $(LIBDIR) to copy gdal.lib $(LIBDIR)

[geos-folder]capi\geos_c.h (this file is restored during build of GEOS): 
Change #include <geos/version.h> to #include <geos_version.h>
Change #include <geos/export.h> to #include <geos_export.h>

[gdal-folder]gcore\gdaldllmain.cpp:
Remove (or comment) the dllmain implementation, because this doesn't work
with static libraries.


## SpatialIndex ##
## For now keep using the 'old' version because the new version of this
## Library isn't compiling
Replace the used extentions "idx" with "mwx" and "dat" with "mwd" 
in storagemanager\DiskStorageManager.cc (lines 36 and 140) and capi\Utility.cc (line 140)
Run makeSpatialIndex-32Bit.bat in a Visual Studio Command Prompt.


## Copy needed files to MapWinGIS folder ##
Run Copy2MapWinGIS.bat
